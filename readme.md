This is a chess implementation on terminal using ruby.
These are the few functions of this chess:

- To select a piece and enter a move, you should type in
  2 number combination such as 2 3 which means the square on
  row 2 and column 3.
- You can save the game on any turn by typing in 'save'
  On your turn to choose a piece. 
- You can also load the game you have saved when starting
  a new game by simply agreeing and typing in the name of 
  the save file
- IMPORTANT! When accidentally chosen a piece, you can simply
  type in cancel or c to choose another piece.
- The stalemate or a draw is decided by the players. 

This was far the most challanging project, and taught me a lot !
